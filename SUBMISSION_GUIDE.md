How to use **The Journey** for your teaching award submission.

## 📋 Submission Overview

**The Journey** is an interactive, gamified experience that showcases your teaching methodology in a memorable, engaging way that evaluators will love.

### Why This Works

Traditional submissions are boring PDFs. **The Journey**:
- ✨ **Stands out** from other submissions
- 🎮 **Engages** evaluators actively
- 📊 **Demonstrates** innovation in teaching
- 💡 **Shows, don't tell** your methodology
- 🏆 **Proves** you practice what you preach (gamification, engagement)
